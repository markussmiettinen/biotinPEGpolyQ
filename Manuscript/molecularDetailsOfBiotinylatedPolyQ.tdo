\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{white}{}{orange!60}{\leavevmode {\color {orange!60}o}}\ {\bf Scaling plots (DL: Oct 25th).} To apply for computing resources we need to run scaling tests. For this we need a system that is as close to the actual system we will work on as possible. Naturally, we can not include biotins and PEGs yet, but pure polyQ will suffice here. To this end we must: {\bf (1)} estimate the size of the fibril (number of Qs, number of waters) we need to simulate, {\bf (2)} build a system of this size (does not need to be a fibril), {\bf (3)} simulate with varying number of cores. }{3}{}
\contentsline {todo}{\color@fb@x {}{white}{}{orange!60}{\leavevmode {\color {orange!60}o}}\ Should probably {\bf discuss the recent paper by de Pablo\nobreakspace {}\cite {Fluitt:2015a}}, where they show how (badly) current MD FFs describe polyQ in solution. Not a crucial problem for us here (which we should point out), as our polyQ is in the fibril, but a worthwhile work nonetheless. }{3}{}
